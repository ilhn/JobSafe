# Earthquake Simulation Game (JobSafe)

## Overview
This project is an educational simulation game built using Unity. The objective is to educate users about correct actions to take during an earthquake through an interactive platform. The game simulates various earthquake scenarios across multiple rooms, challenging players to react correctly in different situations.

## Features
- **Platform-Based Gameplay**: Navigate through different rooms using arrow keys to experience different stages of the earthquake simulation.
- **Player Interaction**: The game uses triggers to interact with the player, providing realistic feedback based on the player's actions.
- **Multi-Level Simulation**: Players must give the correct inputs to advance through the stages.
- **Audio and Visual Stimuli**: Includes sound effects and visual cues to enhance the earthquake simulation experience.
- **Earthquake Effect**: Camera movements simulate shaking to replicate the feel of an earthquake.
- **Educational Objective**: The player is expected to demonstrate appropriate responses during an earthquake, reinforcing real-world earthquake preparedness.

## Installation
1. **Download the Game Files**:
   - Download the ZIP file containing the game from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMnmRhVR1VssX0JgP_GAVtGugl-wHIXr/view?usp=sharing).
